Test Annotation : Imported from Test NG , This is used to create and run our test cases
If there is no priority the test will be running as alphabetical order
@BeforeMethod : Runs before every method and we generally use as setUp method to create driver - maximise it - implicitly wait etc.
It is like precondition .
@AfterMethod  : Runs after every test method . We can name it as tearDown method to quit the driver - to take screenshots .
ignore annotation : If we want to ignore some tests- methods (there can be some unstable issues ) we can skip our tests with ignore
Test (enabled=false)  is nearly same with ignore
Test (priority =1 ) is used to prioritise our cases.
